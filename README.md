# AMS - Achievement Management System
The Achievement Management System (AMS) is a web-based platform designed to streamline
the process of tracking, managing, and analyzing academic and extracurricular achievements
for students and teachers. It provides dedicated dashboards for both roles, enabling efficient
interaction and data management. Students can view their achievements, analyze progress over
time, and update their profiles, while teachers can input and verify student accomplishments
across various categories such as hackathons, paper presentations, coding competitions, and
symposiums.
